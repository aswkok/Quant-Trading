```

### Complete Enhanced MACD Strategy Implementation

The Enhanced MACD Strategy implements sophisticated momentum analysis with precise entry/exit rules:

#### **üÖ∞Ô∏è Case A: No Stock Holding (Flat Position)**
1. **Buy when**: MACD Line crosses above Signal Line (Bullish crossover)
2. **Short when**: MACD Line crosses below Signal Line (Bearish crossunder) - *Disabled in long-only mode*
3. **Buy on Momentum Strengthening** *(Long-only mode)*: Advanced entry detection
   - ‚úÖ MACD Line is below Signal Line (still bearish overall)
   - ‚úÖ MACD Slope is increasing or near zero (momentum recovering)
   - ‚úÖ Absolute Histogram is compressing (bearish strength weakening)

#### **üÖ±Ô∏è Case B: Holding Long Position**
3. **Sell + Short when momentum weakens**:
   - ‚úÖ MACD Line is above Signal Line
   - ‚úÖ MACD Slope is decreasing or near zero (< slope_threshold)
   - ‚úÖ MACD Histogram is smaller than the average of the last 3 values
4. **Exit Position (Failsafe)**: When MACD Line falls below Signal Line (Bearish crossunder)

#### **üÖ≤Ô∏è Case C: Holding Short Position** *(Disabled in long-only mode)*
5. **Buy to Cover + Buy when momentum strengthens**:
   - ‚úÖ MACD Line is below Signal Line
   - ‚úÖ MACD Slope is increasing or near zero (> -slope_threshold)
   - ‚úÖ Absolute Histogram is smaller than the average of the last 3 absolute values
6. **Exit Position (Failsafe)**: When MACD Line rises above Signal Line (Bullish crossover)

### Enhanced Strategy Parameters:
- `--slope-threshold`: MACD slope sensitivity (default: 0.001)
- `--slope-lookback`: Periods for slope calculation (default: 3)
- `--histogram-lookback`: Periods for histogram averaging (default: 3)
- `--long-only`: Enable long-only mode (no short selling) to avoid PDT restrictions

### Day Trading Buying Power Solutions

If you encounter `"insufficient day trading buying power"` errors:

#### **Solution 1: Use Long-Only Mode (Recommended)**
```bash
python integrated_macd_trader.py --symbol NVDA --strategy enhanced_macd --long-only --shares 100
```
- Disables all short selling that requires day trading buying power
- Maintains full Enhanced MACD analysis and momentum detection
- Works with accounts that have regular buying power but no PDT status

#### **Solution 2: Reduce Position Size**
```bash
python integrated_macd_trader.py --symbol NVDA --strategy enhanced_macd --shares 10
```
- Use smaller quantities to stay within buying power limits
- Gradually increase as your account grows

#### **Solution 3: Check Account Status**
The system now provides detailed diagnostics when PDT errors occur:
- Shows total vs. day trading buying power
- Identifies Pattern Day Trader status
- Suggests specific solutions based on your account

### Data Export and Analysis

**CSV Export with Enhanced MACD Analysis:**
```python
from enhanced_quote_monitor import EnhancedQuoteMonitor
from strategies import EnhancedMACDStrategy

# Export real-time quotes with Enhanced MACD data
monitor = EnhancedQuoteMonitor('NVDA')
monitor.save_enhanced_macd_csv()  # Exports comprehensive trading data

# Export strategy signals for backtesting  
strategy = EnhancedMACDStrategy(long_only=True)  # Long-only version
signals = strategy.generate_signals(historical_data)
strategy.save_signals_to_csv(signals, symbol='NVDA')
```

**Exported Data Includes:**
- Real-time quotes (bid, ask, mid, spread)
- MACD calculations (EMAfast, EMAslow, MACD, Signal, Histogram)
- Enhanced analysis (MACD_slope, Histogram_avg, momentum indicators)
- Trading signals (crossover, crossunder, position changes)
- Actions and trigger reasons (BUY, SELL, MOMENTUM_WEAKENING, FAILSAFE_EXIT, etc.)

## MACD Trading Strategy Details

The system implements both Classic and Enhanced MACD strategies with sophisticated momentum analysis:

### Core MACD Components
- **MACD Line**: The difference between a fast EMA (default: 13-period) and a slow EMA (default: 21-period)
- **Signal Line**: An EMA of the MACD line (default: 9-period)
- **Histogram**: The difference between the MACD line and signal line

### Classic MACD Strategy

**Trading Rules:**
1. **Initial Position Rules**:
   - When no position exists:
     - If MACD is above the signal line: BUY shares
     - If MACD is below the signal line: SHORT shares

2. **Crossover Signals**:
   - When MACD crosses above the signal line ("crossover"):
     - If currently short: Cover the short position AND buy additional shares
     - If no position: Buy shares
   - When MACD crosses below the signal line ("crossunder"):
     - If currently long: Sell all shares AND short additional shares
     - If no position: Short shares

3. **Position Mismatch Handling**:
   - If long but MACD is below signal line for >15 minutes: Sell and short
   - If short but MACD is above signal line for >15 minutes: Cover and buy

## Enhanced MACD Strategy Implementation

The Enhanced MACD Strategy provides sophisticated momentum analysis with failsafe exit conditions:

### Strategy Architecture

**Core Philosophy**: Combines traditional MACD crossover signals with advanced momentum detection to reduce whipsaws and improve entry/exit timing.

### Case-Based Trading Logic

#### **üÖ∞Ô∏è Case A: No Stock Holding**
- **A.1 Buy**: MACD crosses above Signal Line ‚Üí Enter long position
- **A.2 Short**: MACD crosses below Signal Line ‚Üí Enter short position *(disabled in long-only mode)*

#### **üÖ±Ô∏è Case B: Holding Long Position** 
- **B.3 Sell + Short**: Advanced momentum weakening detection
  - MACD above Signal Line (still bullish overall)
  - MACD slope decreasing (momentum slowing)
  - Histogram below recent average (weakening strength)
- **B.4 Failsafe Exit**: MACD crosses below Signal Line ‚Üí Guaranteed exit

#### **üÖ≤Ô∏è Case C: Holding Short Position** *(Long-only mode: disabled)*
- **C.5 Cover + Buy**: Advanced momentum strengthening detection
  - MACD below Signal Line (still bearish overall)
  - MACD slope increasing (momentum recovering)
  - Histogram compression (weakening bearish strength)
- **C.6 Failsafe Exit**: MACD crosses above Signal Line ‚Üí Guaranteed exit

### Long-Only Mode Features

When `--long-only` is enabled:
- **No short selling**: Eliminates day trading buying power requirements
- **Enhanced entry detection**: Three ways to enter long positions
- **Case A.1**: BUY on bullish crossover (traditional)
- **Case A.2**: STAY_FLAT instead of SHORT (no bearish entries)
- **üÜï Case A.3**: BUY on momentum strengthening (advanced entry)
- **Case B.3**: SELL instead of SELL_AND_SHORT (exit only)
- **Case B.4**: SELL instead of SELL_AND_SHORT (failsafe exit)
- **Case C**: Completely disabled (no short positions to manage)

#### **Advanced Long-Only Entry Logic**
The long-only mode captures **momentum strengthening signals** that would trigger short position exits (Case C.5) and converts them into long entry opportunities:

```
Market Scenario: Bearish trend with emerging strength
Time    MACD    Signal   Slope      Histogram    Action
10:00   -0.08   -0.05    -0.002     -0.03       STAY_FLAT (bearish)
10:15   -0.06   -0.04    -0.001     -0.025      STAY_FLAT (improving)
10:30   -0.05   -0.03    +0.0005    -0.02       üÖ∞Ô∏è BUY (Case A.3)
10:45   -0.02   -0.01    +0.001     -0.01       HOLD LONG
11:00   +0.01   +0.02    +0.002     +0.005      HOLD LONG (now bullish)
```

**Result**: Enters long position **before** traditional bullish crossover, capturing more upward movement.

### Technical Indicators

**MACD Slope Calculation:**
```python
slope = (macd_recent[-1] - macd_recent[0]) / (lookback_period - 1)
momentum_weakening = slope < threshold and histogram < histogram_average
```

**Histogram Analysis:**
- Rolling average over configurable periods
- Absolute value analysis for short position momentum
- Compression detection for trend reversal signals

### Strategy Characteristics

#### **Standard Enhanced MACD:**
- **Trend-following**: Works best in trending markets
- **Full-cycle**: Always in the market (either long or short)
- **Momentum-based**: Trades on price momentum rather than price levels
- **Adaptive**: Uses EMAs which give more weight to recent prices
- **Enhanced precision**: Early momentum detection reduces whipsaws

#### **Long-Only Enhanced MACD:**
- **Selective entries**: Three sophisticated entry mechanisms
- **Risk-controlled**: Only long positions, no short squeeze risk
- **Momentum-optimized**: Captures early momentum shifts in both directions
- **PDT-compliant**: No day trading buying power requirements
- **Bull-market focused**: Maximizes upward moves, sits out downtrends

### Safeguards
- Warm-up period collects sufficient data before trading
- Time-based throttling prevents excessive trading in choppy markets
- Extended hours trading uses limit orders with adjusted prices based on spread
- Comprehensive logging and state persistence for robust operation
